The Top 12 Load Balancing Techniques to Keep on Your Radar


𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗻 (𝗪𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗨𝗻𝘄𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗱):

Distributes incoming requests sequentially across all servers in the list. In the weighted version, servers are assigned weights based on their capacity, and those with higher weights receive a proportionally higher number of requests.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝗪𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗨𝗻𝘄𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗱):

Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. In the weighted version, servers with higher capacities are assigned higher weights and may receive more requests even if they have more connections than a lighter server.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲:

Routes incoming requests to the server with the lowest response time for a new connection.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘄𝗶𝗱𝘁𝗵 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱:

Directs traffic to the server that's currently handling the least amount of data measured in Mbps.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁𝘀:

Sends incoming requests to the server that has received the fewest number of packets, indicating lighter workloads.

𝗜𝗣 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵:

Determines the server to handle a request by hashing the IP address of the client. This ensures that a particular client (based on IP) will always be directed to the same server.

𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆):

Ensures that a client, once connected to a server, remains connected to that same server for the duration of its session. This is particularly useful for applications that store session information locally on the server.

𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝟳 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Makes routing decisions based on the content of the message rather than just how the message is requested or where it comes from. This includes routing based on URL, type of data being requested (like video vs. text), or other information in the HTTP header.

𝗚𝗲𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Routes requests based on the geographic location of the client, potentially reducing latency by connecting users to the nearest data center or server.

𝗗𝗡𝗦 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Uses the Domain Name System to direct users to the best server based on various strategies, often before the connection to the server is even made.

𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗧𝗖𝗣 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗨𝗗𝗣):

Distributes incoming traffic based on transport layer protocols. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, ensuring that a full message is delivered. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery or order of the packets.

𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗜:

Uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze current traffic in real-time and predictively adjust routing decisions based on traffic patterns, server health metrics, and other relevant data points.
