### What is the difference between Kernal space and user space in Linux?
In computer operating systems, particularly in Unix-like systems, the concepts of kernel space and user space refer to different areas of memory that are allocated for different purposes.

1. Kernel Space: The kernel space is a protected and privileged area of memory that is reserved for the operating system's kernel. It contains the core components of the operating system, including device drivers, process and memory management, file systems, and networking protocols. The kernel space is executed in a highly privileged mode and has direct access to the system hardware and resources. It is responsible for managing and controlling the overall operation of the computer system.

2. User Space: The user space is the portion of memory where user applications and programs run. It is a restricted area and is isolated from the kernel space. User applications, such as web browsers, word processors, media players, and other software, execute in user space. These applications do not have direct access to the underlying hardware or system resources. Instead, they interact with the kernel by making system calls, which are requests for services or resources provided by the operating system.

The separation between kernel space and user space provides several benefits, including security, stability, and resource management. By isolating user applications from the kernel, the operating system can protect critical system resources from being accessed or modified by unauthorized processes. It also allows the kernel to maintain stability since a bug or crash in a user application does not directly affect the entire system. Additionally, the separation enables the operating system to allocate and manage system resources efficiently by enforcing policies and scheduling mechanisms.
