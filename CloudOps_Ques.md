## Answers Version 1:

What are the main differences between cloud architecture and standard architecture?

The main differences between cloud architecture and standard architecture are:

Resource ownership: In cloud architecture, the cloud provider owns and manages the underlying hardware and software resources. In standard architecture, the organization owns and manages the underlying hardware and software resources.
Resource access: In cloud architecture, users and applications access resources through a network connection. In standard architecture, users and applications access resources directly from the underlying hardware.
Resource scalability: Cloud architecture is designed to be scalable, so resources can be easily added or removed as needed. Standard architecture is not as scalable, so it can be more difficult to add or remove resources.
Resource cost: Cloud architecture is typically more cost-effective than standard architecture, especially for organizations that only need to use resources on an as-needed basis.
What are the most important metrics in cloud computing?

The most important metrics in cloud computing are:

Cost: The cost of cloud computing can vary depending on the type of resources used, the amount of time they are used, and the cloud provider. It is important to track cloud costs to ensure that they are not exceeding budget.
Performance: Cloud computing can provide significant performance improvements over standard architecture. However, it is important to monitor cloud performance to ensure that it meets expectations.
Availability: Cloud computing can provide high availability, but it is important to have a plan in place in case of an outage.
Security: Cloud computing can provide a high level of security, but it is important to implement security measures to protect data and applications.
What is a good way of securing data for cloud transport?

There are a number of good ways to secure data for cloud transport, including:

Encryption: Data can be encrypted before it is transported to the cloud. This will make it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access the data.
Authentication: Users and applications can be authenticated before they are allowed to access data in the cloud. This will help to prevent unauthorized access to data.
Authorization: Users and applications can be authorized to access specific data in the cloud. This will help to prevent users from accessing data that they are not authorized to see.
Logging: Cloud providers typically log all access to data in the cloud. This logging data can be used to track and investigate unauthorized access attempts.
What do you think are the main benefits of cloud computing?

The main benefits of cloud computing include:

Scalability: Cloud computing is scalable, so resources can be easily added or removed as needed. This can save organizations money on resources that are not being used.
Cost-effectiveness: Cloud computing can be more cost-effective than standard architecture, especially for organizations that only need to use resources on an as-needed basis.
Performance: Cloud computing can provide significant performance improvements over standard architecture. This is because cloud providers can pool resources from multiple servers to provide a single, high-performance environment.
Availability: Cloud computing can provide high availability, with most cloud providers offering a service level agreement (SLA) that guarantees a certain level of uptime.
Security: Cloud providers typically have a strong security posture, with a variety of security measures in place to protect data and applications.
Can you briefly explain some of the different cloud service models?

There are three main cloud service models:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): IaaS provides the basic building blocks for cloud computing, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications.
Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS provides applications that are hosted and managed by the cloud provider.
What are the different types of models commonly used for deployment in cloud computing?

There are three main types of models commonly used for deployment in cloud computing:

Public cloud: Public clouds are owned and operated by cloud providers and are available to the general public.
Private cloud: Private clouds are owned and operated by individual organizations.
Hybrid cloud: Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds.
Briefly describe how security management is handled within cloud computing.

Security management in cloud computing is handled by a combination of the cloud provider and the organization using the cloud. The cloud provider is responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure, while the organization is responsible for the security of its data and applications.

The cloud provider typically has a number of security measures in place, such as:

Physical security: The cloud provider's data centers are typically located in secure facilities with controlled access.
