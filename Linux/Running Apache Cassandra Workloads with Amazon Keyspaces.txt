Hello, Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look at running
Apache Cassandra workloads with Amazon Keyspaces,
and this does actually come up in the exam.
Often Keyspaces can be used as a distractor,
but you just need to know what it is and what it's used for.
So what is Cassandra?
That's what we're going to cover off.
Then we're going to look at what is Keyspaces.
Going to look at why you should use Amazon Keyspaces,
and we'll go onto my exam tips.
So what is Cassandra?
Well, basically it's a distributed database.
That means it just runs on many, many machines that uses
NoSQL and it's primarily used for big data solutions.
So enterprises, such as Netflix use Cassandra
on their backend.
So just think of big database workloads that's distributed
across many different servers.
So what is Amazon's Keyspaces?
Well, you'd be very surprised to learn that it's basically
Amazon's Cassandra database service that's fully managed.
So it allows you to run your Cassandra workloads
on the AWS cloud.
That's all it is.
So why should you use it?
Well, it's a fully managed database service.
You don't need to worry about managing servers,
software, patching, et cetera.
And Keyspaces is serverless, which means you only pay
for the resources that you use and the service can
automatically scale tables up and down in response
to your applications.
So onto my exam tips.
Now if you see a scenario question about migrating
a big data Cassandra cluster to AWS,
I want you to think of Amazon Keyspaces.
Amazon Keyspaces can also be used as a distractor.
So if you see the word Keyspaces,
I want you to think immediately is this scenario question
talking about Cassandra workloads?
If not, then that is not the correct answer.
So that is it for this lecture, everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.
